These are usually automatically determined by the API. Here are some examples.\r\n  EXPECTED_NOVA_SERVER_URL = 'nova.rc.nectar.org.au'\r\n  EXPECTED_NOVA_PORT = '8774'\r\n  EXPECTED_NOVA_DIRS_URL = '/v1.1/YOUR_TENANT_ID'\r\n```\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n-------\r\n\r\nTo run the unit tests use (you will need to have nose installed):\r\n  nosetests tests/api_test.py\r\n\r\nWARNING: Be aware that, at the moment, the unit tests run against OpenStack using your credentials. The tests do stuff like renaming instances and setting metadata.\r\n","tagline":"","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
